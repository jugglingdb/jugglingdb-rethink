## JugglingDB-RethinkDB

RethinkDB adapter for [jugglingdb](https://github.com/1602/jugglingdb).

**Attention! JugglingDB is awfully maintained. I fix bugs and update this adapter for newer RethinkDB versions if requested, but I suggest you to use other ORM for Node. If you know good one which does not have RethinkDB support yet -- let me know.**

## Usage

To use it you need `jugglingdb@0.2.x`.

1. Setup dependencies in `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "dependencies": {
        "jugglingdb": "0.2.x",
        "jugglingdb-rethink": "latest"
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

2. Use (default options, you can omit them):

    Important: database must exist.

    ```javascript
        var Schema = require('jugglingdb').Schema;
        var schema = new Schema('rethink', {
            host: "localhost",
            port: 28015,
            database: "test",
            poolMin: 1,
            poolMax: 10
        });
        ...
    ```

3. Connection pooling

    RethinkDB adapter supports connection pooling via generic-pool module.
    Pooling is enabled by default and can not be disabled for now.
    You can change pooling options specifying parameters poolMin (default: 1) and poolMax (default: 10).
